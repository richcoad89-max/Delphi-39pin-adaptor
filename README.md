Uses following hardware;

Delphi 39pin FCI male
Keystone 3568 mini blade fuseholder
JWT 1x02 header for power/ground pins
PinSocket 2x20 P2.54mm 

Options to configure less commonly used functions such as stepper, secondary injector circuits or use spare pins of Delphi connector with specific through holes to solder to, keeping the design clean.

Please note the pinout is set to my build (5cylinder) so please ignore the function column.
